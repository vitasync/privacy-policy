CarbSync: Food Log — Privacy Policy

Effective date: 30 August 2025
Developer: VitaSync Labs — vitasynclabs@gmail.com 

CarbSync (“we”, “our”, “the App”) helps you log foods, carbs and supplements. This policy explains what data is processed and your choices.

1) What we collect

A. Data you provide

Profile details you choose to enter (e.g., age, sex, country, dietary preferences).

Meal/supplement logs, servings, and settings.

Storage: These are saved locally on your device. We do not receive your logs unless you explicitly share them (e.g., export, backup, or support email).

B. Data from your device/services

Advertising & measurement (AdMob). Google AdMob and its partners may process the Android Advertising ID, IP address, coarse location, device info, and app interaction for ad serving, personalization (where consented), and fraud prevention.

Crash & usage diagnostics (Firebase). Firebase Crashlytics (and optionally Analytics if enabled) collect crash traces and basic app usage to improve reliability.

Barcode & search lookups. When you scan or search, the App requests product data from public sources such as Open Food Facts and USDA FoodData Central; your query/barcode is sent to those services to return results.

Optional AI helpers. If enabled features are used (e.g., OCR/autofill, text suggestions), requests may be processed by providers such as Google ML Kit or OpenAI. We don’t send your identity; only the minimal text/image snippet needed for the feature.

2) How we use data

Provide core features (food lookup, logging, nutrient math).

Show ads and measure performance via AdMob (or non-personalized ads if you choose).

Improve stability and diagnose issues via Crashlytics/Analytics.

Prevent abuse and keep the service secure.

3) Your choices & consent

EEA/UK/CH: We use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to collect consent for personalized ads where required. You can choose personalized, non-personalized, or opt-out where available, and revisit choices in the consent dialog (from the app settings if provided) or your device ad settings (reset/limit Ad ID).

US state privacy (e.g., CA/VA/CO/CT/UT): You may choose to limit data use for targeted advertising where applicable.

4) Sharing

We don’t sell your personal data. Limited data is shared with:

Google AdMob (ads & measurement) — see Google Ads privacy: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads 

Google Firebase (crash & analytics) — https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy 

Open Food Facts / USDA (to fetch public product data you request).

AI/OCR providers used only when you invoke those features.

These providers process data under their own policies and compliance programs.

5) Retention

Your logs stay on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app.

Ad/analytics and crash data are retained by providers per their policies and legal requirements.

6) Children

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). If you believe a child has used the App and provided information, contact us.

7) Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect data processed by the App. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

8) Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data, and to withdraw consent.
Contact us at vitasynclabs@gmail.com and we’ll help route the request (e.g., to Google for AdMob/Crashlytics data).

9) Changes

We may update this policy. We’ll post the new version with an updated “Effective date”.
